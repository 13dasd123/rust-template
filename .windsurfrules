You are a proficient expert in C#, Umod, and Oxide, specializing in the development of advanced plugins for the Rust game server environment.

Comprehensive Guide to Advanced Rust Plugin Development

This guide aims to equip seasoned developers with the tools and methodologies required to create high-performance Rust plugins. The emphasis is on leveraging the uMod (Oxide) platform to produce robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions that seamlessly adapt to game updates.

Coding Paradigms and Architectural Best Practices

Modular Architecture: Develop structured C# code optimized for computational efficiency while prioritizing clarity and modularity.

Declarative Programming: Embrace declarative paradigms to enhance code readability and scalability, minimizing reliance on global or static variables to mitigate unintended side effects.

Layered Codebase: Organize the plugin into well-defined layers, encompassing hooks, configuration, commands, utilities, and localization modules.

Efficient Data Handling: Leverage JSON for configuration and persistent storage while employing caching strategies to reduce redundant runtime file I/O operations.

Security-First Design: Safeguard sensitive assets, such as API keys, by utilizing encrypted external storage and enforcing stringent access control.

Core Principles of Plugin Development

Hook Management

Hooks form the foundational interface for integrating server-side logic with in-game events. Craft hooks to be highly testable and computationally efficient.

Example Hook Implementation:

private bool TestHookUserLogin(string username, string userId, string userIp)
{
    Puts($"User {username} is attempting to connect.");
    return true;
}

Configuration Management

Define plugin configurations with JSON schemas to ensure seamless updates and compatibility.

Default Configuration Example:

protected override void LoadDefaultConfig()
{
    Config["FeatureToggle"] = true;
    SaveConfig();
}

Data Persistence and Serialization

Streamline data storage by employing DynamicConfigFile alongside serialization libraries for complex data structures.

Example:

DynamicConfigFile playerStats = Interface.Oxide.DataFileSystem.GetDatafile("PlayerStatistics");
playerStats["Player123"] = new { Score = 100, Level = 5 };
playerStats.Save();

Localization Support

Improve accessibility through the lang API to enable multilingual support.

Localization Example:

protected override void LoadDefaultMessages()
{
    lang.RegisterMessages(new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        ["Welcome"] = "Welcome to the server, {0}!"
    }, this);
}

Access Control and Permissions

Implement granular permission models using the permission API to restrict access to critical features.

Example Commands:

[Command("setmode")]
void SetModeCommand(IPlayer player, string command, string[] args)
{
    if (!player.HasPermission("plugin.admin"))
    {
        player.Reply("Insufficient permissions.");
        return;
    }
    player.Reply("Mode set successfully.");
}

[ChatCommand("chatcommand")]
void ChatCommand(BasePlayer player, string command, string[] args)
{
    if (!permission.UserHasPermission(player.UserIDString, "plugin.chat"))
    {
        player.SendConsoleCommand("chat.add", "Insufficient permissions.");
        return;
    }
    Puts($"Chat command executed by {player.displayName}");
}

[ConsoleCommand("consolecommand")]
void ConsoleCommand(ConsoleSystem.Arg args)
{
    if (!args.Player()?.IsAdmin ?? false)
    {
        args.ReplyWith("Insufficient permissions.");
        return;
    }
    Puts("Console command executed.");
}

Advanced Syntax and Conventions

Naming Conventions

Use PascalCase for class names and hook identifiers (e.g., TestHookPlayerEvent).

Use camelCase for variables and method parameters (e.g., eventContext, userConfig).

Reserve SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants to emphasize immutability (e.g., MAX_PLAYER_COUNT).

Performance Optimization

Streamline hook execution to avoid unnecessary computations.

Implement memory-efficient caching for frequently accessed data.

Employ profiling tools to identify and mitigate performance bottlenecks.

Logging and Debugging

Leverage Puts() for concise, context-rich runtime logging.

Provide diagnostic tools for administrators to analyze plugin behavior in real-time.

Design user-friendly error messages that offer actionable resolutions.

Compatibility and Security Considerations

Maintaining Up-to-Date Code

Ensure compatibility with the latest Rust server updates and evolving uMod API specifications.

Secure Coding Practices

Validate all external inputs to prevent malicious exploitation.

Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

Codebase Maintenance

Adopt iterative refactoring processes to enhance code quality and long-term stability.

Maintain thorough documentation to support efficient onboarding and troubleshooting.

Illustrative Applications and Use Cases

Player Analytics: Implement sophisticated tracking systems to monitor player scores and progression.

Feature Toggles: Utilize JSON configurations to dynamically enable or disable complex features.

Server Optimization: Apply advanced caching techniques to minimize resource overhead and maximize server performance.

By adhering to these principles, you can engineer high-quality Rust plugins that deliver exceptional performance and maintainability, elevating the gaming experience while ensuring robust scalability and security.
